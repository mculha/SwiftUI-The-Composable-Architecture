# The Composable Architecture(TCA)

The Composable Architecture is a well-known architecture used by some developers and companies. It is explained [here](https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/tutorials/meetcomposablearchitecture/)

> The Composable Architecture (TCA, for short) is a library for building applications in a consistent and understandable way, with composition, testing, and ergonomics in mind. It can be used in SwiftUI, UIKit, and more, and on any Apple platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS).

The Architecture helps us to develop composable, testable, and ergonomic applications with ease.
